/**
 * DOCTYPE tokens have a name, a public identifier, a system identifier, and a force-quirks flag.
 * When a DOCTYPE token is created, its name, public identifier, and system identifier must be marked
 * as missing (which is a distinct state from the empty string), and the force-quirks flag must be set
 * to off (its other state is on).
 *
 * Start and end tag tokens have a tag name, a self-closing flag, and a list of attributes, each of 
 * which has a name and a value. When a start or end tag token is created, its self-closing flag must 
 * be unset (its other state is that it be set), and its attributes list must be empty. 
 * 
 * Comment and character tokens have data.
