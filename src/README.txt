Dominos aims to be a cross-platform DOM based formats manipulation library. The goal is to let you manipulate (parse, edit, serialize) any DOM based document format (XML, HTML, SVG, XUL...).

Use cases: reading, edition, creation, validation of DOM documents on both server side or client side.

Dominos is Haxe 3 only (and has been tested so far only with haxe 3 RC 1).

The current implementation of Dominos partially supports the HTML 5 current specifications only. 

WARNING: This project is under heavy development. Packages and classes are likely to change in the next weeks. If you use it, be prepared to readapt your code in a few monthes.
