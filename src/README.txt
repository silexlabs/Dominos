Dominos is a cross-platform DOM based formats manipulation library. It aims to let you manipulate (parse, edit, serialize) any DOM based document format (XML, HTML, SVG, XUL...).

Use cases: reading, edition, creation, validation of DOM documents on both server side or client side.

The current implementation of Dominos supports only the partial HTML 5 current specification.
